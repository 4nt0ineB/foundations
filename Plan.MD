## Chapter 1: FP Basics / motivation
Reason about your program

* e.g. new job, large code base, dependencies/mutability everywhere
* how often have you heard: "it works on my machine", "..."
* large piece of software is always difficult to maintain, test help but for me fp is the key to write/update code without worry/fear
* immutability: when I have an object, I can do whatever I want with it. I don't need to worry about other people reference on this object
* pure function: no need to check result type for null / catch exception, signature do not lie == some documentation for free, memoization/caching
